### Sheeptalk

A finite-state automaton for recognizing sheeptalk. Any string consisting of 'b' followed by at least two 'a' and culminating in '!' is sheeptalk. No other string is sheeptalk.

Based on an exercise introduced in *Speech and Language Processing* by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin.
